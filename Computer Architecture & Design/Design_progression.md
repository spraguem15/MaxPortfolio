<h1>Early design</h1>

Early on in this class we started with a simple design by working on a single cycle processor. This processor would ideally complete 1 instruction per clock cycle, ignoring any memory accessses. Although the design worked well, it was not optimized well leaving a lot of room for imporvement. Below is the RTL used for the single cycle design.
