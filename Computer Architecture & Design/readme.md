<h1>Project Overview</h1>

My work with Computer Architecture & Design was within a class labeled Purdue ECE 437. This class taught the fundamentals of computer design and provided insight into how the modern computer operates. The project involved with this class was designing a dual-core, cache-coherent CPU with synchronization. The design of the project was done in pairs by the students with consideration from textbooks and teaching assistants. The class was very difficult overall, but taught me many valuable lessons, both technical and general. The following folder contains schematics and other information that was created through the class. Unfortunately, the code from this class cannot be shown because it is under NDA protection.
