<h1>Project Overview</h1>

ASIC Design Laboratory (also know as ECE 337), was an introductory course to standard cell design. This class had a wide variety of labs to complete, all cummulating with a final project that combined different elements of previous labs. Although I had used SystemVerilog prior to this class, I was able to get a great understanding of how to utilize the language to turn a design into testable code. This class was also a great way to help me into more difficult projects such as the Computer Architecture & Design and my Datacenter Network Accelerator project. 

<h2>Lab coverage</h2>

There were many different labs in this class that introduced common designs used as standard cells in hardware today. Below is a list of labs we completed throughout the semester:
