<h6>Lab where we made an AHB model</h6>

<h1>Project Overview</h1>

ASIC Design Laboratory (also know as ECE 337), was an introductory course to standard cell design. This class had a wide variety of labs to complete, all cummulating with a final project that combined different elements of previous labs. Although I had used SystemVerilog prior to this class, I was able to get a great understanding of how to utilize the language to turn a design into testable code. This class was also a great way to help me into more difficult projects such as the Computer Architecture & Design and my Datacenter Network Accelerator project. 

<h2>Lab coverage</h2>

There were many different labs in this class that introduced common designs used as standard cells in hardware today. Below is a list of labs we completed throughout the semester:

<ul>
<li>Introduction to pipelining</li>
<li>Variable Counters</li>
<li>State Machines</li>
<li>APB & AHB</li> 
<li>Convolution Machines</li>  
</ul>

<h2>Final Project</h2>

The final Project in this class was done over several weeks ending with a demonstration to teaching assistants to ensure functionality. The goal of the project was to create a USB to bus system transmitter, that would take data from a USB and send those bits to a bus system that would then send the data where it needed to go. It was also capable of reading data from the bus system that would be sent back to the USB for storage. This project was done in groups of three with each person responsible for a unique aspect of the design. My responsiblity was making sure the AHB (Advanced High Performance Bus) worked as expected. The next page titled Project Details will go in more depth on this project.
