<h1>Final Project Details</h1>

The goal of this project was less about understanding how this design was used within a computer, but being able to put a complex system together in SystemVerilog. Prior to this point in this class we did not have to work with any major integration challenges. Each lab was unique from the other which gave us a fresh start each week. However, for this lab each person worked on their own part, which then prompted collaboration with other group members to ensure timing and connectivity was correct.
