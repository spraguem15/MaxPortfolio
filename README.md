# MaxPortfolio
Welcome to my personal page detailing the projects I've had the opportunity to be apart of over the course of my career. Each folder contains information about different projects that I've had the opportunity to work on over the course of my college experience. I will go into detail the goal of the project from a ten thousand foot view, then dive into more details about the project. I'll also detail the contributions, challenges and progress I made within these projects. The goal of this page is to demonstrate the technical abilites I have aquired, but also the problem solving abilities I've learned from my time in these classes. Whether you're a recruiter, student, or collaborater I hope this page gives a clear view of my skills, interests, and committment to building well designed solutions.
