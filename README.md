# MaxPortfolio
Welcome to my personal page detailing the projects I've had the opportunity to be a part of over the course of my career. Each folder contains information about different projects that I've had the opportunity to work on over the course of my college experience. I will go into detail on the goal of the project from a ten-thousand-foot view, then dive into more details about the project. I'll also detail the contributions, challenges, and progress I made within these projects. The goal of this page is to demonstrate the technical abilities I have acquired, but also the problem-solving abilities I've learned from my time in these classes. Whether you're a recruiter, student, or collaborator, I hope this page gives a clear view of my skills, interests, and commitment to building well-designed solutions.
