<h1>My contributions</h1>

As mentioned earlier, my contributions mainly relate to the base transport header (BTH). To provide further insight on this layer I will post a screenshot below that contains more precise information regarding this layer.

<h2>Project background</h2>

This project is apart of my senior design project which spans from August 2025 to May 2026. This project is still currently in progress, with said progress ramping up in the spring of 2026. Much of our team's progress was hindered by our understanding of networks and their compatability with computers. As a result much of Fall 2025 semester was spent gaining background on networks with many of us taking a computer prototyping class (Computer Architecture & Design project). Some of the networks topics we covered relate to Packets & messages, TCP vs. UDP, RDMA, NICs and more. After building up our understanding of networks we used a scientific journal as a baseline for our project for reference. 

<h2>Current Progress</h2>

Much of the progress we have made has come in the form of planning and developing our understanding. We have also programmed all of our parts individually and are in the testing phasing before we begin integrating our project together. My contributions relates to programming the generating aspect of the BTH layer. As shown in the figure from the "readme" there is a generating and parsing side to our system. Once our system has accessed the RDMA of the kernel/CPU we will have access to the information that was requested from the original sender. This information should now be put together as shown in the picture above.
